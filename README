LAB 1A:

OVERALL DESIGN:
Data structures written
stack, vector, dynamic string class

METHODS:
clean_raw_buff
  . We cleaned the raw buffer of bytes read in from the file first. This includes
	removing all excess whitespace(and replacing it with \0 to seperate words), 
	removing comments.
  . As we did this we checked for grammar and exited the enitre program if something
	was wrong.
  . We then returned a correct buffer representing the script.

parse_command_tree
  . We used two stacks holding command_t and opperators (similar to handling infix
	algebra) to create command tree.

NOTES:
  . for semicolons at the end, we ignored it since it did not make sense to have a
	sequence command with only one command but it's not syntatically incorrect

LAB 1B:

Concerns and Limitations:
  . We assumed that execvp would close any open files
  . Subshell commands that contain multiple commands requiring inputs are not
  	properly dealt with. 

  	For example: (wc && wc -l) < foo.txt
